# COMP_128

## This will be my repository for COMP 128 projects. I will update this readme file as I upload the projects

* Down Payment Calculator
  * I made this program to calculate down payments based off of certain condition (the price of the house)
    * The program consists of a while loop in order keep the program running based on user input
    * Furthermore, it uses conditionals to calculate the amount the down payment must be based off of the user input

* Calculator
  * I made this program to make basic calculations with the standard operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
    * The prgram consists of a while loop in order to keep the program running based on user input
    * Furthermore, it uses conditionals to calculate the argument that the user inputs

* Shopping Cart
  * I made this program that essentially gives the user a list of things that he can order. This includes the item, the price, and if it is taxable or not.
    * The program consists of three lists that have the items, the pie prices, and if it is taxable or not
    * It works by selecting the pie and if they would like to keep shopping. It then appends the pie purchases to a list and calculates your total.
    * It first uses a while loop in order for the customer to continue using the program then it uses some conditionals to find if the pie is taxable or not
    * Finally it uses a for loop to keep track of your shopping car and how many pies and what type of pies you purchased

* Guessing game
  * I made this program a guessing game where the user inputs a six-letter word and then allows the guesser to guess that word.
    * The program consists of a while loop to ensure that the user inputs a six letter word
    * Then a for loop follows to make sure that the guesser has a limited amount of turns
    * If the user gets a letter correct, it replaces the blanks given with the spot where the letter is supposed to go
    * If the user gets a letter wrong, it appends the used letter list
